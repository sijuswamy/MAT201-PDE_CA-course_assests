## Formation of PDE by Elimination of Arbitrary Function

To form a partial differential equation (PDE) by eliminating an arbitrary function from a given equation, follow these steps:

### Method-2 {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note}
## Algorithm (Method of Elimination of arbitrary function)
- **Step 1:** Differentiate partially the given static equation.
- **Step 2:** Eliminate the arbitrary function(s) and its derivables using the expression for partial differentials.
:::

>*Example 1:* Find the PDE of the equation $z = f(x, y)$. where $f(x, y)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$ and $y$.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Differentiate with Respect to $x$ and $y$

Differentiate the given equation with respect to $x$ and $y$ to form new equations involving the partial derivatives.

Differentiate with respect to $x$:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f(x, y)}{\partial x}
$$

Let $p = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$:

$$
p = f_x(x, y)
$$

Differentiate with respect to $y$:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial f(x, y)}{\partial y}
$$

Let $q = \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$:

$$
q = f_y(x, y)
$$

Step 2: Form the PDE

Divide the equations for $p$ and $q$:

$$
\frac{p}{q} = \frac{f_x(x, y)}{f_y(x, y)}
$$

Since $f(x, y)$ is arbitrary, $f_x(x, y)$ and $f_y(x, y)$ are just partial derivatives of the function. The relationship simplifies to:

$$
\frac{p}{q} = 1
$$

So, the PDE is:

$$
p = q
$$

>*Example 2:* Form a PDE from the general dependancy relationship, $z=yf\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$ by eliminating the arbitrary function.

**Solution:**

Given static equation is $$z=yf\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$$ {#eq-eqn-1}

Differentiating (@eq-eqn-1) partially with respect to $x$, we get:

$$\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial x}=yf'\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\left(-\dfrac{y}{x^2}\right)$$  

or $$f'\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)=-\frac{x^2}{y^2}p$$ {#eq-eqn-2}

Differentiating (@eq-eqn-1) partially with respect to $x$, we get:

$$\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial y}=yf'\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\left(\dfrac{1}{x}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$$ {#eq-eqn-3}

Using (@eq-eqn-1), and (@eq-eqn-2) in (@eq-eqn-3), we get:

\begin{align*}
q&=\dfrac{y}{x}\times \left(\dfrac{x^2}{y^2}\right)p+\dfrac{z}{y}\\
&=-\frac{x}{y}p+\frac{z}{y}\\
\implies z&=px+qy
\end{align*}

>*Example 3:* Form a PDE from the equation $z=f(x^2-y^2)$, where $f$ is an arbitrary function.

**Solution:**

Given $$z=f(x^2-y^2)$$ {#eq-eqnp2}

Differentiating (@eq-eqnp2) partially with respect to $x$ and $y$, we get:

\begin{align}
p&=f'(x^2-y^2)\times 2x \\ 
q&=f'(x^2-y^2)\times -2y 
\end{align}

 $$\therefore \dfrac{p}{q}=-\frac{x}{y}\implies py+qx=0$$

### Additional Problems:

**Problem:**

Form the partial differential equation by eliminating the arbitrary function from $f(x+y+z,x^2+y^2+z^2)=0$.
  

>**Solution:**

Let $x+y+z=u$, $x^2+y^2+z^2=v$, then $f(u,v)=0$

Differentiating with respect to $x$ and $y$, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&=&0\\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(1+p)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(2x+2zp)=0$.............(1)


$\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}\left(\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial z}q\right)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}\left(\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial z}q\right)=0$

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(1+q)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(2y+2zq)=0$.............(2)


Eliminating $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}$ and $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}$ from (1) and (2), we get:

\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix}
~~1+p &2x+2zp~\\
~~1+q &2y+2zq~
\end{vmatrix}&=0\\
(1+p)(2y+2zq)-(1+q)(2x+2zp)&=0\\
\text{ Or}\quad (y-z)p+(z-x)q&=x-y
\end{align*}

, which is a partial differential equation of the first order.

**Problem:**

Form the partial differential equation by eliminating the arbitrary function from $f(xy+z^2,x+y+z)=0$.

>**Solution:**

Let $xy+z^2=u$, $x+y+z=v$, then $f(u,v)=0$.

Differentiating with respect to $x$ and $y$, we get:


\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&=&0\\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(y+2zp)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(1+p)=0$.............(1)

$\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}\left(\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial z}q\right)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}\left(\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial z}q\right)=0$

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(x+2zq)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(1+q)=0$.............(2)


Eliminating $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}$ and $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}$ from (1) and (2), we get:

\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix}
~~y+2zp &1+p~\\
~~x+2zq &1+q~
\end{vmatrix}&=0\\
(y+2zp)(1+q)-(x+2zq)(1+p)&=0\\
\text{ or } \,(2z-x)p+(y-2z)q&=x-y
\end{align*}
which is a partial differential equation of the first order.


**Problem:**

Form the partial differential equation by eliminating the arbitrary function from $f(x^2+y^2+z^2,z^2-2xy)=0$.
  
>**Solution:**

Let $x^2+y^2+z^2=u$, $z^2-2xy=v$, then $f(u,v)=0$.

Differentiating with respect to $x$ and $y$, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&=&0\\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(2x+2zp)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(2zp-2y)=0$.............(1)

$\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}\left(\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial z}q\right)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}\left(\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial z}q\right)=0$

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(2y+2zq)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(2zq-2x)=0$.............(2)

Eliminating $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}$ and $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}$ from (1) and (2), we get:

\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix}
~~2x+2zp &2zp-2y\\
~~2y+2zq &2zq-2x
\end{vmatrix}&=0\\
(2x+2zp)(2zq-2x)-(2y+2zq)(2zp-2y)&=0\\
\text{or} \,(y+x)zp+(y+x)zq&=y^2-x^2\\
\implies\, (p-q)z&=y-x
\end{align*}
which is a partial differential equation of the first order.

**Problem:**
	Form the partial differential equation by eliminating the arbitrary function from $f(x^2+y^2,x^2-z^2)=0$
 
>**Solution:**

Let $x^2+y^2=u$, $x^2-z^2=v$, then $f(u,v)=0$.

Differentiating with respect to $x$ and $y$, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&=&0\\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(2x)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(2x-2zp)=0$.............(1)

$\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}\left(\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial z}q\right)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}\left(\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial z}q\right)=0$

or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}(2y)+\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}(-2zq)=0$.............(2)

Eliminating $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}$ and $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}$ from (1) and (2), we get:

\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix}
~~2x &2x-2zp\\
~~2y &-2zq
\end{vmatrix}=0\\
(2x)(-2zq)-(2y)(2x-2zp)&=0\\
\implies yp-xq&=\dfrac{xy}{z},
\end{align*}

which is a partial differential equation of the first order.

**Problem:**	Form PDE using, $f(x^2+y^2,z-xy)=0$

>**Solution:**

Given,
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x^2+y^2,z-xy)&=&0\\  
or\,\,f(u,v)&=&0
\end{eqnarray}
where $u=x^2-y^2$ and $v=z-xy$.

Differentiating given equation partially with respect to $x$ and $y$, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&=&0\\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}2x+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}.(p-y)&=&0\\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}2y+\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}.(q-x)&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

A non-trivial solution of the above equation is:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{|cc|}
2x&p-y\\
2y&q-x
\end{array}=0
\end{equation*}

On expanding the determinant, we get
$$xq-yp=x^2-y^2$$
