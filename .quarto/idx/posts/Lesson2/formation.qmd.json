They are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables and are fundamental in describing various physical phenomena such as heat conduction, wave propagation, and fluid dynamics.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Formation of PDEs**: A PDE can be formed by eliminating arbitrary constants or functions from an equation involving multiple variables. For example, from $F(x, y, z, a, b) = 0$, eliminate $a$ and $b$ to obtain a PDE in $x, y, z$.\n\n2. **Order of a PDE**: The order is determined by the highest order of the partial derivative present in the equation. For instance, $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$ is a second-order PDE because the highest derivative is second order.\n\n3. **Linear vs Nonlinear PDEs**: Linear PDEs involve linear terms of the unknown function and its derivatives, while nonlinear PDEs involve nonlinear terms. For example, $u_t = \\alpha u_{xx}$ is a linear PDE, and $u_t + u u_x = \\nu u_{xx}$ is a nonlinear PDE.\n\n4. **Homogeneous vs Inhomogeneous PDEs**: Homogeneous PDEs have no terms independent of the unknown function and its derivatives, whereas inhomogeneous PDEs have additional terms. For instance, $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$ is homogeneous, while $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = f(x, y)$ is inhomogeneous.\n\n### Formation of PDEs\n\nThere are three approaches to form PDE from a static equation.\n\n1.
